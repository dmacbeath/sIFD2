# Spawning
- [x] Spawning rates
- ~~before spawning mob, check for possible spawn locations \
put locations in list and randomise which ones to pick, need coords (col, row) ~~
- ~~number of spawns is based on level number \
if mobs == 0 move to next level~~
- [ ] Spawn over time - not fun if everything spawns all in the beginning
- [ ] Better Spawn rate
